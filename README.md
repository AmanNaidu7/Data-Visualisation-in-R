# Data-Visualisation-in-R
In this project I use the ggplot2 library in R to plot a number of visualisation.  

An explanation of the code used and the process that was followed can be found in the .rmd file provided.

The output produced is in the .html file provided.

Unfortunately this file is too large and needs to be downloaded for viewing.

The process involves creating a number of visualisations as per the requirements of the quiz questions provided in the .html file.
